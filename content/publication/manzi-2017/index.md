abstract: We tested the hypothesis that parental support for autonomy moderates the
  effects of societal threat to safety on the development of right-wing authoritarianism
  (RWA). In a quasi-experimental study performed on 241 Italian university students,
  societal threat to safety fostered RWA only among participants who reported low
  levels of parental support for autonomy.
