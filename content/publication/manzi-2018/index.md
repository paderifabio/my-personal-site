abstract: © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Previous studies have shown that the presence
  of age-based stereotypes in the workplace is often associated with lower levels
  of work engagement and adjustment among older employees. This study examines possible
  mediators and moderators of this relationship using data from a sample of 2,348
  older (age textgreater 50) employees at the Italian national rail company. We test
  a model in which the effects of age-based stereotype threat on organizational involvement,
  future time perspective, and psychological well-being are mediated by work–age identity
  integration (how much individuals see their age and organizational identities as
  compatible and blended). Secondly, we explored whether these effects are moderated
  by gender and job status. Results indicate that age-based stereotypes are associated
  with negative outcomes for employees' work and personal adjustment, and that these
  relationships are partially mediated by variations in work–age identity integration.
