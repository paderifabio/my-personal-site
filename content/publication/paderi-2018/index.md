abstract: Age-related stereotypes are an ongoing threat in the workplace. As documented by the United Nations (UN, 2007), the positive contribution of older workers (e..g, those over 50 years) is often overshadowed by ageing stereotypes. Considering that gender stereotypes are still alive in organizations, ageism places women at risk for double discrimination. We present a study that examines in a sample of 4962 Italian employed women (age >= 50) how gender- and age-related stereotype threats impact the congruity between their gender, age, and professional identities (i.e., gender/age/professional identity integration), psychological well-being, and job engagement. Results show that age stereotype threat not only leads to experiencing less age-gender identity integration but also less gender-work identity integration. The same effect was observed for gender stereotype threat, Women experiencing higher levels of gender stereotype threat reported lower levels of both gender-work identity integration and age-work identity integration.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: What happens when a woman, besides facing gender discrimination in her workplace, becomes a senior worker and therefore also runs into age discrimination?
