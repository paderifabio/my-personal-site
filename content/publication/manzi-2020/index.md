abstract: © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Over the past decades, employment rates of
  older workers in most Western countries have rapidly increased. Hence, there is
  a growing interest in identifying the organizational dimensions that might impact
  the psychosocial adjustment of workers aged over 50 years. This study focuses on
  perceived organizational support (POS) and identity-related measures (identification
  and authenticity) as key organizational components for workers at this stage of
  life. Furthermore, in the relationships discussed, we explore the moderating role
  of perceived age discrimination. In an ample sample of older workers (N = 4,563,
  aged 50–66 years), a moderated mediational model was tested where older workers'
  involvement was associated to POS. In the model, this relationship was mediated
  by organizational identification and authenticity, and the association between POS,
  identity-related measures, and involvement was moderated by age-based discrimination.
  Results showed that POS is associated with organizational involvement via organizational
  identification and authenticity and that high level of age discrimination decreased
  the positive association between POS, organizational identification, authenticity,
  and involvement.
